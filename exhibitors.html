%0A%0A
That�s why, this College, as well as introducing our new products and services, marketing tools and strategies, we�ll also be sharing our leadership agenda with you. 
%0A%0A
Given that this will enable Partners to take advantage of conversations we�re having with business leaders, incorporating them into client engagements and strategies, this event is going to be verypopular.
So to avoid a scrum, we thought we�d better book a bigger venue. 
%0A%0A
Like Twickenham Stadium. 
We�ve got a lot planned � and I�ll be in touch with more details over the coming weeks. 
%0A%0A
I�m looking forward to seeing you there.

									Smarter Commerce is a unique approach that increases the value companies generate f
                                    or their customers, partners and shareholders in a rapidly changing digital world. 
                                    Smarter Commerce puts the customer at the centre of all operations, analysing critical 
                                    customer and operational data – from multi channel buying behaviours to social media 
                                    content – and builds business processes that help companies buy, market, sell and service 
                                    their products accordingly.  This leads to greater customer loyalty, revenue and profit 
                                    margin growth, and agility. No matter how far along your company is, IBM can help enhance,

									IBM MSP Programme: Accelerate growth through a valuable strategic partnership
                                </h1>
								<p>
									Midmarket companies are increasingly turning to service providers to manage their 
                                    IT infrastructure. This presents a growing opportunity for Managed Service Providers 
                                    (MSPs). To meet future demand, MSPs must be able to expand infrastructure and 
                                    service delivery capabilities while minimizing cost and disruption to their own 
                                    business. 
								</p>
                                <p>
									Teaming with IBM helps MSPs capitalize on the new market opportunities by providing 
                                    the right mix of services, products, and programs.
