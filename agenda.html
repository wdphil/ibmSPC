%0A%0A
That’s why, this College, as well as introducing our new products and services, marketing tools and strategies, we’ll also be sharing our leadership agenda with you. 
%0A%0A
Given that this will enable Partners to take advantage of conversations we’re having with business leaders, incorporating them into client engagements and strategies, this event is going to be verypopular.
So to avoid a scrum, we thought we’d better book a bigger venue. 
%0A%0A
Like Twickenham Stadium. 
We’ve got a lot planned – and I’ll be in touch with more details over the coming weeks. 
%0A%0A
I’m looking forward to seeing you there.
